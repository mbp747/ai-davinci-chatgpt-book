# AI PDF TO BOOK with Davinci and Chat Gpt

in this repo we build a machine learning model with openAI's davinici in order to read in a PDF file, chunk it into pieces, and then output a short version of the book. 

then ran those shorter chunks of the book through chat GPT in order to expand on the writing a bit.

i ran it through two sets of AI, Davinici + chat gpt which runs on GPT 3.5 in order to make sure it is as original as possible.
